        <p><b>the first dynasy</b> of ancient egypt<sup>(dynasty I)</sup>covers the first series of egyptian kings to rule over a unified egypt.<sub>[1]</sub>it immediately follows the unification of upper and lower egypt, possibly by narmer, and marks the beginning of the early dynastic period, when power was centered at thinis.<sub>[2]</sub></p>
        <h2>the dynasty</h2>
        <p>information about this dynasty is derived from a few monuments and other objects bearing royal names, the most important being the narmer palette and narmer macehead,as well as den and qa'a king lists. no detailed records of the first two dynasties have survived,except for the terse list on the palermo stone. the account in the manetho's aegyptiaca contradicts both the archeological evidence and the other historical records: manetho names nine rulers of the first dynasty, only one of whose names matches the other sources, and offers information for only four of them. egyptian hieroglyphs were fully devoloped by then, and their shapes would be used with little change for more than three thousand years.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>
